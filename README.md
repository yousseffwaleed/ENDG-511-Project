# Mushroom Classification using CNNs, Transfer Learning & Prototypical Networks

This project explores multiple machine learning approaches to classify mushrooms as **edible** or **poisonous** based on images. It includes standard CNNs, transfer learning using pre-trained models (EfficientNetB0, ResNet50), and few-shot learning using Prototypical Networks.
